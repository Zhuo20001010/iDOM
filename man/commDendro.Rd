\title{Generate Molecular Dendrogram}
\usage{
commDendro(mol.trait, type, trait_col, peak.2.peak = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{mol.trait}{A data frame containing molecular traits which must include a column for molecular formula ('MolForm') and may include other specified traits.}

\item{type}{A character string specifying the type of dendrogram to generate: 'MCD' for Molecular Characterization Dendrogram, 'TD' for Transformation Dendrogram, and 'TWCD' for Transformed Weighted Characterization Dendrogram.}

\item{trait_col}{A vector of character strings specifying the names of molecular traits to use in the analysis.}

\item{peak.2.peak}{An optional data frame of peak-to-peak relationships, defaulting to \code{peak.2.peak}. It is used in the TD and TWCD methods to determine the connections based on transformations. Default: NULL}
}
\value{
A dendrogram object representing the relationships among molecules.
}
\description{
This function analyzes molecular traits or transformation data to generate dendrograms. It supports multiple methods for dendrogram generation, including molecular characterization dendrograms (MCD), transformation dendrograms (TD), and transformed weighted characterization dendrograms (TWCD).
